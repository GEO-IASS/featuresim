Overview
--------

FEATURESIM is a matlab toolbox for generating image projections of 3D features.  The target application 
of this toolbox is analsis of sparse feature based computer vision algorithms for unmanned aerial vehicles.

* Generate random or structured 3D points and project to a camera with given interior and exterior orientation
* Generate ground truth stereo projections, fundamental matrix and display epipolar lines
* Generate projections given arbitrary camera intrinsics to support parameter search and selection
* Display tools to show camera projections and camera parameters and camera pose
* A demonstration highlighting common usage patterns
